# Game-of-Life
Conway's Game of Life written in python, making use of the matplotlib library.

Import the game from the directory you have it saved in (e.g. by using sys) and then type game_of_life.play() to play the game of life.
There are many options as to how to initially configure the board. One may choose the size of the board, as well as initialise configurations that I have saved in the code (e.g. the gospel glider gun) by specifying its location and orientation. Further, one may also "click in" squares they want the game to start with. Once this is all decided, the number of generations may be chosen and then the game will run for said number of generations.

Let me know if there's any issues:)
